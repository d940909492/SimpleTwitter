# *Simple Twitter*

**Simple Twitter** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).


## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x ] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  - [x ] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  - [ x] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
  - [x ] User is taken back to home timeline with **new tweet visible** in timeline
  - [x ] Newly created tweet should be manually inserted into the timeline and not rely on a full refresh
